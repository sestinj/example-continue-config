# Example Continue Configuration

If you are using the Continue LLM Proxy, you can leave the "models" array as is, and it will automatically detect the models that you have configured.

If you are using tab autocomplete, be sure to enter the name of the model you are hosting in place of `"<MY_AUTOCOMPLETE_MODEL_NAME>"`.

Continue will work well with the remainder of the configuration options left as they exist here.
